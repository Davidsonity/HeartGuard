### **INTRODUCTION**
#### **Objectives**
The objective of this project is to use Machine learning to predict Heart Failure of a patient.

#### **About Dataset**
This dataset contains the medical records of 299 patients who had heart failure, collected during their follow-up period, where each patient profile has 13 clinical features. 

**Data Source:** http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+failure+clinical+records

**Attribute Information:**
Thirteen (13) clinical features:
- age: age of the patient (years)
- anaemia: decrease of red blood cells or hemoglobin (boolean)
- high blood pressure: if the patient has hypertension (boolean)
- creatinine phosphokinase (CPK): level of the CPK enzyme in the blood (mcg/L)
- diabetes: if the patient has diabetes (boolean)
- ejection fraction: percentage of blood leaving the heart at each contraction (percentage)
- platelets: platelets in the blood (kiloplatelets/mL)
- sex: woman or man (binary)
- serum creatinine: level of serum creatinine in the blood (mg/dL)
- serum sodium: level of serum sodium in the blood (mEq/L)
- smoking: if the patient smokes or not (boolean)
- time: follow-up period (days)
- death event: if the patient deceased during the follow-up period (boolean)
